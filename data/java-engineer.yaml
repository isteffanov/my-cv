      title: Contextual Spell Checking with Levenshtein Automata
      subtitle: Sofia University, Information Retrieval
      text: |
        Proved that with smart implementation and engineering know-how the problem of spell-checking could be done near-instantly. With the core of the project being in \textbf{C++}, I then packaged it, then used \textbf{Python} to do contextual search and prediction using \textbf{PyTorch} via classical approaches like \textbf{CBoW} and modern ones, such as \textbf{Transformer} architectures to do \textit{spell-checking like never done before}.
